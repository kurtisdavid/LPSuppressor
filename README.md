# LPSuppressor

The goal of this project is to remove any notification of LP gain/loss for a ranked game. To do this, we make use of the unofficial [League Client API](https://riot-api-libraries.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lcu.html) to automate skipping the post game lobby.

Huge thanks to [lcu-driver](https://github.com/sousa-andre/lcu-driver) for making this possible in Python3.
