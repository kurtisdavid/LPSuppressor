# LPSuppressor

The goal of this project is to remove any notification of LP gain/loss for a ranked game. To do this, we make use of the unofficial [League Client API](https://riot-api-libraries.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lcu.html) to automate skipping the post game lobby.

Huge thanks to [lcu-driver](https://github.com/sousa-andre/lcu-driver) for making this possible in Python3.

## Download

To obtain executables, look for Releases on the right sidebar of the project. Or view them here:

- [Windows 10](https://github.com/kurtisdavid/LPSuppressor/releases)

Other platforms will be supported in the future.

## Instructions

1. Open the League Client. 
2. Run the downloaded executable (e.g. `lcu_exit.exe`).
3. If you see "This script will only execute a post-game lobby exit command.", then it has started running in the background.
4. Play your ranked game and profit!
